# Final Project - Scoala Informala | Front End Web Development

### This project is a travel app that, which obtains a desired trip location & departure date from the user, and displays weather for a maximum of 7 days ahead with an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs.

* If there is no picture for the desired location, a representative country image will be displayed. The app also displays the flag of the country next to the date as well as icons and representative images for the weather forecast. 

### The web app also displays a list containing the main attractions for the desired trip location as well as a currency converter from the user's local currency to the trip location's currency.
